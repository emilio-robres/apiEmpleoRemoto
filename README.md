This is not an official project. It's made by Emilio Robres

## 1. How I worked on this project?</br>

My goal was to simulate a professional work environment.  

  * I built this app based on my own Figma designs reproducing JOB TODAY website: [Screenshot of designs]
  * I used github commands to control sucesivas versions of the app
  * I used React.js for coding

## 2. How to navigate this project? 

  -	I organized the app in different files inside scr:
    - Components
    - Images (img)
    - Pages
  - I created different components: Logo, LogIn, GetJobs and Form
  -	The application gets data from the REMOTE.IO API: https://remotive.io/api/remote-jobs

## 3. Why I built the project this way? 
-	For this simple app I use `axios` to get the job from the API. 
-	I use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage the app states.
-	I use `useHistory` to navigate between pages.
-	I didn't use `useContext` since I wanted to keep the project simple.
-	I use flexbox for positioning the different elements inside pages.
-	I use`Bootstrap-5` for styling.
